    question: "What's the difference between gross and net pay?",
    answer: "Gross pay is your total earnings before any deductions. Net pay is what you actually take home after taxes, Social Security, Medicare, and other deductions are subtracted. Think of gross as 'before' and net as 'after'!"
  },
  {
    question: "How does compound interest work?",
    answer: "Compound interest means you earn interest on both your original money AND the interest you've already earned. It's like a snowball rolling down a hill - it gets bigger and bigger! The key is time - the longer you leave your money invested, the more powerful compound interest becomes."
  },
  {
    question: "Why should I start investing young?",
    answer: "Time is your superpower when investing! Starting at 25 vs 35 can mean hundreds of thousands more dollars by retirement, even with the same monthly contributions. This is because of compound interest - your money has more time to grow and multiply."
  },
  {
    question: "What's an emergency fund?",
    answer: "An emergency fund is money set aside for unexpected expenses like car repairs, medical bills, or job loss. Aim for 3-6 months of living expenses in a savings account. It's your financial safety net that prevents you from going into debt when life happens!"
