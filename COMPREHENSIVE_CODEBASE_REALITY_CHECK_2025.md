## 🔧 **DOCUMENTATION UPDATE REQUIREMENTS**

### **Completely Outdated Documentation (Needs Rewrite)**
1. **README.md** - Claims basic features, we have advanced platform
2. **NEXT_LOGICAL_STEPS_ROADMAP.md** - Suggests adding spaced repetition (already exists!)
3. **FINAL_CHAPTERS_1-9_STATUS_REPORT.md** - Accurate for chapters 1-9 only
4. **All Chapter Audit Reports** - Only cover chapters 1-9

### **Documentation to Create**
1. **CHAPTERS_10-17_ANALYSIS.md** - Assessment of built but untested chapters
2. **CHAPTERS_18-30_ROADMAP.md** - Detailed plan for remaining chapters
3. **CURRENT_FEATURE_INVENTORY.md** - What we actually have vs. what docs claim
4. **TESTING_STRATEGY_COMPLETION.md** - Plan to test chapters 10-17

### **Instruction Files to Update**
1. **`.github/copilot-instructions.md`** - Update with current architecture
2. **`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`** - Reflect actual 2025 state
3. **`docs/COMPONENT_GUIDE.md`** - Include all 900+ components
4. **`docs/QUICK_START.md`** - Update for current build process
