# ðŸ§  Spaced Repetition Integration - COMPLETED

## âœ… **SPACED REPETITION IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY**

We have successfully integrated **full SM2 spaced repetition** into Finance Quest! Here's what's now available:

### **ðŸ”¬ Core Algorithm Features**
- **SM2 Algorithm**: Industry-standard spaced repetition (SuperMemo 2)
- **Ease Factor Calculation**: 1.3 - 2.5 range for optimal scheduling
- **Interval Scheduling**: 1 day â†’ 6 days â†’ exponential growth
- **Performance Tracking**: Accuracy, speed, confidence, response time
- **Adaptive Difficulty**: Questions adjust based on performance

### **ðŸŽ¯ Enhanced Quiz Engine Features**
- **Automatic Concept Tracking**: Every quiz question tracks financial concepts
- **Real-time Performance Analysis**: Tracks accuracy, speed, confidence
- **Due Cards Management**: Shows concepts ready for review
- **Progress Visualization**: Mastery levels, repetition counts
- **Smart Review Scheduling**: Optimal timing for long-term retention

### **ðŸ“Š Spaced Repetition Dashboard**
- **Due Cards Counter**: Shows number of concepts ready for review
- **Learning Stats**: Total concepts, due for review, mastered concepts
- **Review Interface**: Clean UI for reviewing spaced repetition cards
- **Progress Tracking**: Repetitions, ease factors, next review dates

### **ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation**
- **React Hook**: `useSpacedRepetition(chapterId)` for easy integration
- **localStorage Persistence**: Client-side storage for learning data
- **SSR Safe**: Proper client-side checks for Next.js compatibility
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety for all spaced repetition features

### **ðŸ“š Chapter 1 Integration Complete**
- **Money Fundamentals Quiz**: Now tracks 8 core financial concepts
- **Concept Mapping**: Each question mapped to specific learning concepts
- **Automatic Card Creation**: New concepts automatically added to spaced repetition
